            <h2>Minesweeper Rules</h2>
            <p>Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game where the objective is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Uncover all the squares on the board that do not contain mines.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Rules:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clicking on a square will reveal what is underneath it.</li>
                        <li>If a square contains a mine, the game ends.</li>
                        <li>If a square does not contain a mine, it will display a number indicating how many adjacent squares contain mines.</li>
                        <li>Use the numbers as clues to determine which squares are safe to click.</li>
                        <li>Right-click or use another method to mark squares you suspect contain mines.</li>
                        <li>The game is won when all non-mine squares are uncovered.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Remember to plan your moves carefully and use logic to solve the puzzle!</p>
